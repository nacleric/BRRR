# What is kubectl
[Documentation Link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)  
The kubectl command line tool lets you control Kubernetes clusters. For configuration, kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable or by setting the --kubeconfig flag.

This overview covers kubectl syntax, describes the command operations, and provides common examples. For details about each command, including all the supported flags and subcommands, see the kubectl reference documentation. For installation instructions see installing kubectl.
